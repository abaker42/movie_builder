Description: This app is a simple movie logger it takes a title, opening lines, and release date
and stores this information in a firbase database. Is also reads all the movies in the database 
currently. It's great practice to see how GET and POST request work in React!

SideNote: Firebase is a temporary database so it may expire in the future. If this happens
just create a new realtime database on firbase and change the url's in the code.
